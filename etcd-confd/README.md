# Setup etcd confd with Hashicorp Vault kv2: Quick and Easy

## prerequisites
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/jassi-devops/kubernetes-tools/tree/main/hashicorp_vault)

## create and enable new secret engine with kv version2
```
vault secrets enable  -path=kv kv-v2
```
> Where kv is secret engine and kv-v2 is kv version

## create new secret and key-value
```
vault kv put -mount=kv database url=mysql.com
```
> Where kv is secret engine, database is secret, url is key and mysql.com is value.

## Establish the confdir directory.
The confdir is the location where template resource configurations and source templates are stored.
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/confd/{conf.d,templates}
```

## Generate a configuration file for template resources, which are specified in TOML format within the confdir.

/etc/confd/conf.d/myconfig.conf.toml
```
[template]
src = "myconfig.conf.tmpl"
dest = "/root/myconfig.conf"
prefix = "/kv/data"
keys = [
    "database"
]
owner = "jenkins"
mode = "0644"
```

## Generate the source template, which consists of Golang text templates.

/etc/confd/templates/myconfig.conf.tmpl
```
[myconfig]
url = {{ getv "/database/data/url" }}
```

## Install Confd

You can install confd by referring to the [official guide](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/blob/master/docs/installation.md), which corresponds to your specific operating system.

## Vault initialization

```
confd -confdir /etc/confd -onetime -backend vault -node https://example.com -client-ca-keys ca_cert.pem -client-cert cert.pem  -client-key key.pem -auth-type token -auth-token <Root_Token>
```
